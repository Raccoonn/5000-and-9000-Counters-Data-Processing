# 5000-and-9000-Counters-Data-Processing
Scripts for cleaning up raw counter data from each machine, as well as plotting the data if desired.


The raw log file for 5000S+ contains a few weird recipes that I dont know what they are, (Ex.: Caffe Latte, Latte Macchiato, Milk Foam, etc.).  The "Primary Recipes.txt" file is used to filter out these other recipes. 

Also included in this repository are example input files, output files, and plots that I have created for the Davis location.


Usage: Simply run main.py and follow command line prompts.
  - Input raw log filename
  - Input desired output filename
  - Plot data if desired
